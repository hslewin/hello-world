My practice space for using GitHub Flow for HCI 5840

Hello!

My name is Heather Lewin.  
I work in at Iowa State University as a Science and Engineering Sujbect Librarian.  I have been there since 2006. 
I am a part-time HCI graduatate student in my second year.

In my free time you can find me hiking, kayaking, playing games with my family, listening to music (mostly k-pop), and doing crossword puzzles (badly).
